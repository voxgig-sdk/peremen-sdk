# Peremen SDK configuration

module PeremenConfig
  # Return the process-wide config, built once on first use. The SDK reads
  # the config on every request and never writes to it, so one instance is
  # shared by every client rather than rebuilt per client.
  #
  # The returned hash is shared: treat it as read-only. Callers that need to
  # mutate should use make_config, which always returns a fresh copy.
  def self.shared_config

  # Build a fresh, fully materialised config hash. Every call rebuilds the
  # whole structure, so prefer shared_config unless you need a private copy
  # you intend to mutate.
